// Given an array of size n
// 1. Write an algorithm to return the minimum and maximum items of the array. What would be the time complexity of this algorithm?
// 2. If the algorithm you wrote isnâ€™t recursive, write a recursive version of it using divide and conquer method. If it is recursive, you are off the hook ðŸ™‚
// 3. Find the recurrence relation of the recursive algorithm

// Same number in both arrays
// You are given two arrays and your goal is to find out if a number that included in the first array is also included in the second array.
// 1.  Write an algorithm that for a given number in the first array will go over all the numbers in the second array.
// 2. Find and write a more efficient solution. What is the time complexity?
